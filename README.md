Hey there! I'm Alok Bhawankar, a 21 year old Student at MITWPU, Software Developer & Cyber Security Engineer. 

I work at The [The S.C.R.I.P.T group](https://thescriptgroup.in), helping each other to learn and develop new things.
We are a community who help other students in learning new technologies by conducting various workshops for free. It's exciting stuff!

Creating beautiful custom rice with various WM is my hobby.

Trying to upskill constantly and yet to learn and explore a lot of things.

I like eating and binging shows and web series!
I'm a bit quirky!
